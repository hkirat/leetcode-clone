## 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

- Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates
  in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the
  elements should be kept the same.

- Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to
  do the following things: Change the array nums such that the first k elements of
  nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially.

```js
function greeting(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
};

greeting("Harkirat");
```
